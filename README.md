# xyz.thoren/julian

A Clojure(Script) library designed to allow conversions between Julian Day
Number and common time.

Julian Day Numbers are represented by a float, and Time is represented
by a map containing the keys `:year`, `:month`, `:day`, `:hour`, `:minute`, and
`:second`.

## Usage

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/xyz.thoren/julian.svg)](https://clojars.org/xyz.thoren/julian)

Require:

``` clojure
(:require [xyz.thoren.julian :refer [jdn->time time->jdn]])
```

### Examples:

`jdn->time` takes a single float as argument.
``` clojure
(jdn->time 2459293.5)
;; => {:year 2021, :month 3, :day 20, :hour 0, :minute 0, :second 0}
```

`time->jdn` accepts between 1 and 6 integer arguments.
``` clojure
(time->jdn 2021 3 20)
;; => 2459293.5
```

A map, such as the one produced by `jdn->time` can be passed as an only
argument to `time->jdn`:

``` clojure
(time->jdn {:year 2021 :month 6 :day 6 :hour 12 :minute 0 :second 0})
;; => 2459372.0
```
